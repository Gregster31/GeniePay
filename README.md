## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (High-Level)

The GeniePay system is structured in modular components that work together to ensure seamless and compliant crypto payroll execution:

1. **Employer Dashboard**: Web interface for HR/payroll teams to manage employees, input salaries, bonuses, and schedules.

2. **Compliance Layer**: Enforces KYC/AML checks, local tax rules, and generates remittance reports. Country-specific logic ensures compliance.

3. **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on supported blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) to manage payroll automation logic such as salary releases, bonus rules, and vesting schedules.

4. **Payment Processor**: Handles the transaction orchestration for paying salaries in stablecoins (e.g., USDC). Monitors gas fees, schedules disbursements.

5. **Employee Wallets**: Can be custodial (for ease of use) or non-custodial (for privacy/security-conscious users). Integrated with wallet providers.

6. **Fiat On/Off Ramps**: Enables employers to fund payroll in fiat and employees to convert crypto into fiat using services like Circle, Transak, or local banking APIs.
