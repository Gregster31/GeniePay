# 💼 GeniePay: Blockchain Payroll System

## 🧭 Executive Summary

**GeniePay** is a compliant blockchain-based payroll system enabling businesses to pay employees and contractors globally in stablecoins, while ensuring full tax and regulatory compliance. We simplify global payroll, reduce fees, increase transparency, and eliminate traditional banking delays.

Goal explained: I want to make a web app where people are freely able to create a team and pay them via (mainly) crypto, so as to bypass the fees from global transactions. The admin of the team would be able to simply add wallets addresses (his employees) and send them money, choosing an automated process if wanted.
---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Paying people in other countries is slow, messy, and expensive. Companies can spend over **$1,000 per employee per year** just to manage international payroll.

- Sending money to contractors overseas often costs **6% or more** in fees and takes up to **5 days** to arrive.

- Most crypto payroll systems don’t handle taxes or legal reporting properly, which makes them risky or unusable for real businesses.

- Pay employees in **stablecoins (USDC, USDT)** instantly.
- Automatically compute, deduct, and remit taxes in supported regions.
- Offer **fiat on/off ramps** for seamless conversion.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (High-Level)

The GeniePay system is structured in modular components that work together to ensure seamless and compliant crypto payroll execution:

1. **Employer Dashboard**: Web interface for HR/payroll teams to manage employees, input salaries, bonuses, and schedules.

2. **Compliance Layer**: Enforces KYC/AML checks, local tax rules, and generates remittance reports. Country-specific logic ensures compliance.

3. **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on supported blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) to manage payroll automation logic such as salary releases, bonus rules, and vesting schedules.

4. **Payment Processor**: Handles the transaction orchestration for paying salaries in stablecoins (e.g., USDC). Monitors gas fees, schedules disbursements.

5. **Employee Wallets**: Can be custodial (for ease of use) or non-custodial (for privacy/security-conscious users). Integrated with wallet providers.

6. **Fiat On/Off Ramps**: Enables employers to fund payroll in fiat and employees to convert crypto into fiat using services like Circle, Transak, or local banking APIs.
